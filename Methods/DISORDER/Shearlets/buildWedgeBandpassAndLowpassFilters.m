%   builds the filters that comprise the shearlet system. Page and equation

%   42,5, 2016
%   * N are the dimensions of the shearlet
%   * K specifies the levels of shearing for each scale
%   * DF is the directional filter
%   * SF1 is the first scaling filter
%   * WF is the wavelet filter
%   * SF2 is the second scaling filter
%   * {COMPLEX} indicates whether complex shearlets are generated, so both
%   sides of the spectrum are not treated symmetrically. Defaults to 0
%   ** WD is the wedge filter
%   ** BP is the bandpass filter
%   ** LP is the lowpass filter

%INITIALIZATION
[DF,SF1,WF,SF2]=parUnaFun({DF,SF1,WF,SF2},@single);
N(end+1:2)=1;
J=length(K);%Number of scales
BP=zeros([N J],'like',DF);%These filters partition the frequency plane into different scales
Kmax=max(K)+1;
WD=cell(1,Kmax);%These filters partition the frequency plane into different directions
DF=DF/sum(abs(DF(:)));%This filter corresponds to the time domain representation of the trigonometric polynomial P (see equation (13) on page 12)

%1D HIGH AND LOWPASS FILTERS AT DIFFERENT SCALES
FHP=cell(1,J);%High pass filter, FHP{J}=g_1 and FHP{1}=g_J (compare page 11) 
FLP1=cell(1,J);%Low pass filter 1, FLP1{J}=h_1 and FLP1{1}=h_J (compare page 11)
FLP2=cell(1,Kmax);%Low pass filter 2, typically we have FLP2{max(K)+1}=FLP1{J}, i.e. FLP2{J}=h_1 (compare page 11)

%INITIALIZE WAVELET HIGHPASS AND LOWPASS FILTERS
FHP{J}=WF;%This filter is typically chosen to form a quadrature mirror filter pair with SF1 and corresponds to g_1 on page 11
FLP1{J}=SF1;%This filter corresponds to h_1 on page 11
FLP2{Kmax}=SF2;%This filter is typically chosen to be equal to SF1 and provides the y-direction for the tensor product constructing the 2D wavelet filter w_j on page 14
